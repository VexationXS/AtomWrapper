Hello, so, im guessing you are wondering what this is. Probably pretty accurate.
WinLua is a lua API/class I made, that uses WinApi to create windows/internal GUIs
with Lua. This allows for easy easy implementation of guis, and modifying them to
a users liking.

Pardon the mess, I was a lot younger when I developed this. I didn't change it after it worked.
This can be capable of being within a DLL, thats what I originally did for it.

There is comments in every file, in both, winlua.h and winlua_util.h, at the bottom there is comments. in WinLua_Scintilla.h there is one at the top.

ValueX/XValue? What is that?
It is another thing I developed, its trash and I should do a lot better, again, I created this a long time ago and I was at
school doing math and so I just figured, hey, why not make a weird variable management that is global!? ya no I have problems help.
